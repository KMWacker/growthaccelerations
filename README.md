# growthaccelerations
STATA code and files for Koopman and Wacker (2023): "Drivers of growth accelerations: What role for capital accumulation?" (World Development, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2023.106297).

The main.do file will estimate growth accelerations with web-sourced data from the PWT10.0. See the introductory comments in this file for setting the path directory and installing relevant STATA packages. See section 3 of the paper for details and discussion of results.

The accelerations_growthaccounting.do file performs the growth accounting (section 4 of the paper) for the identified growth accelerations.

The accelerations_robust_DeHaan.do file offers an alternative to identifying the growth accelerations (see section 5.1 in the paper).

The code in the files was prepared by Eline Koopman under the supervision of Konstantin M. Wacker at the University of Groningen (2022-2023).
